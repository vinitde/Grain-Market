Automated PLC-based system for filling and sealing food bags, designed to simulate an industrial food packaging process. The system operates as follows:

1. Bag Detection and Start: The process begins when an empty bag is placed on the conveyor belt. A start sensor detects the presence of the bag, signaling the system to begin filling.


2. Filling Process: Once detected, the filling valve is activated, allowing the bag to be filled with feed. This continues until a filled sack sensor detects that the bag has reached the required capacity. Upon confirmation, the conveyor belt motor is activated, moving the filled bag forward.


3. Sealing Process: The conveyor belt transports the filled bag to the sewing station, where it is detected by the sewing sensor. The conveyor belt halts for the sealing process, during which the sewing machine operates for a specified pause of 3 seconds to securely seal the bag.



This automated solution offers a realistic simulation of food industry processes, enabling precise control over bag filling and sealing. It provides efficient and accurate packaging operations suitable for industrial-scale applications, ensuring each bag is filled and sealed consistently before moving to the next stage in the productionÂ line.
